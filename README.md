👋 Hi, I'm Mehmet a hacker from the Netherlands 🇳🇱.
👀 I have a keen interest in cyber security.
🌱 Currently, I'm preparing for the OSCP certification.
💞️ I'm open to collaboration on various projects. Feel free to make a pull request and I'll review it.
📫 As for reaching out to me, I prefer to communicate with people I already know. If we haven't met, I'm cautious about direct communication.

🔓 **Note on Project Releases**: The tools shared here are often ones I use during red team engagements and pentests.
